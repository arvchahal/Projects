Hi I am Arnav Chahal, a computer science student at Vanderbilt University,
this is my financial options pricer used to price the theoretical value of an options contracts

====================================================================
## Features

- Black-Scholes Model: Implementation of the Black-Scholes Model for calculating the
        theoretical price of European call and put options.

- Monte Carlo Simulation: Monte Carlo simulation used for estimating the price of an option.

- Binomial Options Pricing Model: Implementation of the Binomial Options Pricing Model that
        computes the price of an option by creating a binomial tree of
        potential future asset prices and working backwards from the end of the tree to the present.

## Dependencies

- Boost libraries for mathematical calculations.
- C++ Standard Template Library (STL).

## Building the project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the project with your preferred C++ compiler, ensuring the Boost libraries are included.
    You might have to download the boost libraries and edit the cmake.txt in order for it to run on
    your computer

Note: This project was written in C++ and hence requires a C++ compiler to run.
It was developed and tested using the clang compiler,
but should work with other C++ compilers as well.

## Usage

Once compiled, you can use the various classes to compute option prices.
Note that the parameters for the models,
such as the stock price, volatility, strike price, risk-free rate,
and time to maturity, must be set according to your requirements.  Additionally this only works for
European options and does not account for dividends earning stocks.
